## Standards 📒

This project follows the
[Media.Monks Frontend Coding Standards](https://github.com/mediamonks/frontend-coding-standards).

## Security 👮‍

### Ignore scripts
In order to mitigate NPM supply chain attacks by best effort the NPM [ignore-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#ignore-scripts) setting is enabled by default. This project
comes with a preconfigured set of dependencies that are allowed to run installation scripts.

After running `npm install` it is required to run `npm run postinstall` to run required installation scripts from dependent packages.

When adding a new dependency that requires an installation script to run make sure to add that package to the project `package.json` in the `postinstall` property.

> Important: After running `npm install` or `npm ci` always run `npm run postinstall` afterwards before running other scripts.
